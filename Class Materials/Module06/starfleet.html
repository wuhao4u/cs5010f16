<h1>Space Invaders</h1>

<p>Earth is being invaded by martians. Here's a description of the
Martian fleet:</p>

<ol>
  <li> The Martians have some spaceships. </li>
  <li> Each spaceship is either a mother ship or a drone.</li>
  <li> A mother ship has a name, which is a String, a crew, which is a
  list of Martians, and a possibly-empty set of daughter ships, each
  of which is a spaceship.</li>
  <li> When we say the fleet of a spaceship, we mean her daughter
  ships and all their fleets.</li>
  <li> A Martian has a name, which is a string, and some other
  attributes, which are unspecified.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write functions to accomplish the following tasks. For each
function, draw its call graph, and write a halting measure. Be prepared
to explain why your halting measure decreases around every cycle in
the graph.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Given a spaceship, is there a Martian named "Mork" in its
  crew?</li>

  <li>Given a spaceship, is there a Martian named "Mork" in its own
  crew or in the crew of one of its daughter ships?  </li>
  
  <li>Given a spaceship, how many Martians named "Mork" are in the
  crew of either the spaceship or its fleet? </li>

  <li>Given a spaceship, return another spaceship just like the
  original, except that all of its daughters that are drones have been
  removed.</li>

  <li>Given a spaceship, return another spaceship just like the
  original, except that all of the drones in its fleet have been removed.</li>

  <li>Given a spaceship, return another spaceship just like the
  original, except that all of its daughters who have a crewmember
  named "Mork" have been removed.  When a daughter is removed from the
  fleet, so are all its daughters and their fleets.</li>

  <li>Given a spaceship, return another spaceship just like the
  original, except that every ship in its fleet who has a crewmember
  named "Mork" has been removed.   When a ship is removed from the
  fleet, so are all its daughters and their fleets.</li>

  close to the problem set. -->
