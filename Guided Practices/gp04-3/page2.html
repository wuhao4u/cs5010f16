<h1>Guided Practice 4.3 Computing On Lists of Structures</h1>

<p>Here is one solution.
</p>

<pre>
;; inventory-total-value : LOB -> Number
;; GIVEN: a LOB
;; RETURNS: the value of all the copies on hand of all the books in the
;; given LOB
;; (inventory-total-value lob1) = 390
;; EXAMPLES/TESTS:

(begin-for-test
  (check-equal? 
    (inventory-total-value empty)
    0
    "value of the empty inventory should have been 0")
  (check-equal?
    (inventory-total-value lob1)
    390
    "simple test"))

;; STRATEGY: Use template for LOB on books
(define (inventory-total-value books)
  (cond
    [(empty? books) 0]
    [else (+
            (book-inventory-value (first books))
            (inventory-total-value (rest books)))]))
</pre>

<p/>

<pre>
;; books-out-of-stock : LOB -> LOB
;; returns a list of the books that are out of stock in the given LOB
;; Example:
;; (books-out-of-stock lob1) =
;;  (list
;;    (make-book "Shakespeare" "Hamlet" 0 2)
;;    (make-book "Shakespeare" "Macbeth" 0 10))
;; STRATEGY: Use template for LOB on books

(define (books-out-of-stock books)
  (cond
    [(empty? books) empty]
    [else (if (book-out-of-stock? (first books))
            (cons (first books) (books-out-of-stock (rest books)))
            (books-out-of-stock (rest books)))]))

(check-equal?
  (books-out-of-stock lob1)
  (list
    (make-book "Shakespeare" "Hamlet" 0 2)
    (make-book "Shakespeare" "Macbeth" 0 10)))

;; book-out-of-stock? : Book -> Boolean
;; returns true iff the given book is out of stock
;; EXAMPLE: 
;; (book-out-of-stock? (make-book "Felleisen" "HtDP/1" 20 7)) = false
;; (book-out-of-stock? (make-book "Felleisen" "HtDP/1"  0 7)) = true
;; STRATEGY: Use template for Book on b
(define (book-out-of-stock? b)
  (<= (book-on-hand b) 0))

(begin-for-test
  (check-false
    (book-out-of-stock? (make-book "Felleisen" "HtDP/1" 20 7)))
  (check-true
    (book-out-of-stock? (make-book "Felleisen" "HtDP/1"  0 7))))

;; (check-equal? ... true) would have been fine, too.  Look at the
;; Help Desk page for check-equal? to see some other useful checks.
</pre>

<p>Note that the design of the help function book-out-of-stock?, with
its deliverables, is required for a perfect solution.  Writing
<pre>
(if (<= (book-on-hand (first lob)) 0) ... ...)
</pre>

matches the template, but it is undesirable because it violates the
principle of one-function-one-task.  It violates this principle
because this version of the function requires books-out-of-stock to
know both about the representation of an inventory AND the
how being out of stock is represented for a book.
