<h1>Guided Practice 7.2</h1>

<p>Consider the computation of</p>

<pre>
(program-all-defined?
    (list
     (make-def 'f1 (list 'x) (make-appexp 'f2 (list (make-varexp 'x))))
     (make-def 'f2 (list 'x 'y) (make-appexp 'f2
                                             (list (make-varexp 'z)
                                                   (make-varexp 'y))))
     (make-def 'f3 (list 'x 'y 'z)
               (make-appexp 'f1 (list (make-appexp 'f2
                                                   (list (make-varexp 'z)
                                                         (make-varexp 'y)))
                                   (make-varexp 'x))))))
</pre>

<p>Which of the following will appear as calls during
this computation?
</p>

<ol>
  <li><kbd>(exp-all-defined? (make-varexp 'z) (list 'f1 'x))</kbd></li>
  
  <li><kbd>(exp-all-defined? (make-varexp 'z) (list 'f3 'x 'y 'z 'f2 'f1))</kbd></li>

  <li><kbd>(exp-all-defined? (make-varexp 'z) (list 'f2 'x 'y 'z 'f1))</kbd></li>

  <li><kbd>(exp-all-defined? (make-varexp 'z) (list 'f3 'x 'y 'f1 'f2 'z))</kbd></li>

</ol>

<h2>ANSWER</h2>

<p>Answer:  There are two occurrences of <kbd>(make-varexp 'z)</kbd> in
this program-- one in the definition of <kbd>f2</kbd> and one in the
definition of definition of <kbd>f3</kbd>.
</p>

<p>According to the definition of <kbd>defs-all-defined?</kbd>, the variables appear in <kbd>vars</kbd>
in the following order:
<ol>
  <li>the name of the function being defined</li>
  <li>the arguments of the function being defined</li>
  <li>the functions defined above the current one, in reverse order.</li>
</ol>
However, the invariant does not require that the variables appear in this order.
</p>

<p>Answer (1) does not occur and does not satisfy the invariant,
because <kbd>z</kbd> does not occur in the definition of
<kbd>f1</kbd>.</p>

<p>Answer (2) occurs for the use of <kbd>z</kbd> in <kbd>f3</kbd>.  It
satisfies the invariant.
</p>

<p>Answer (3) does not occur and does not satisfy the invariant.
There is no occurrence of <kbd>z</kbd> for which these are the available
variables. </p>

<p>Answer (4) does not occur, but it does satisfy the invariant.
These are exactly the variables that are available for the occurrence
of <kbd>z</kbd> in <kbd>f3</kbd>, but this is not the order in which
the variables are listed in the algorithm (compare with answer (2)).</p>
