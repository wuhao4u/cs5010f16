<h1>Guided Practice 8.4</h1>

<p>In the adjacency-list representation of graphs, a graph is
represented as a list of node-information items, where each
node-information item consists of the node and the list of successors
of that node.  Here's a data definition and an example:</p>

<pre>
;; A Graph is a ListOfNodeInfo
;; A NodeInfo is a (list Node ListOfNode)
;; WHERE: If the graph is 
;; '((n_1 (n_11 n_12..))
;;   (n_2 (n_21 n_22 ...))
;;   ...),
;; then:
;; there are no repetitions among the n_i
;; AND for each i, there are no repetitions among n_i1, n_i2, etc.
;; AND every node that occurs as an n_ij is also listed among the n_i.
;; INTERPRETATION: the ni are the nodes in the graph, and n_i1, n_i2,
;; etc., are the successors of n_i

;; EXAMPLE:

(define graph1
  '((a (c))
    (b (a c))
    (c ())))
   
;; represents the same graph that used to be represented as
;;   (list
;;     (make-edge 'a 'c)
;;     (make-edge 'b 'a)
;;     (make-edge 'b 'c))
</pre>

<p>What is the <em>least</em> amount that
needs to be done to convert 08-7-reachability.rkt to use this representation?
</p>

<p>Hint: This is easy.</p>
