<p>You are designing a computer system for a car dealer.  The dealer
takes orders for cars from a customer.  Your job is to design the data
for an order.
</p>

<p>Here is the information in an order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An order includes the customer.</li>
  <li>An order includes a description of the car being
  ordered.</li>
  <li>An order includes the price.</li>
  <li>An order includes the date of the order.</li>
  <li>A customer has a last name, a first name, and an address.</li>
  <li>An address has many fields, which we won't talk about here.</li>
  <li>A car has a Vehicle Identification Number, which is a String.</li>
  <li>A car has a Model, which is a String.
  <li>A car has an interior color.</li>
  <li>A car has an exterior color.</li>
  <li>A car may or may not have a sunroof.</li>
  <li>A car may have one of the following: a Plain Radio, a Fancy
  Stereo, or a Navigation System.</li>
  <li>A Fancy Stereo comes with a some number of speakers.  The number
  of speakers is always even and may be between 2 and 12.</li>
  <li>There are two kinds of Navigation Systems:  one that uses Google
  Maps, and one that uses Apple Maps.</li>  

</ol>

<p>Design the data for this system.  Write down the data definitions
you need for this system.  Your data must interact with some large existing
system, so make as few assumptions about the data representation as
possible.  Write down a list of the data definitions that you expect
the existing system to supply.</p>
