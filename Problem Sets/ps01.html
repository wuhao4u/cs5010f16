<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 01: Hello, World!</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, September 12, 2016 (revised: Sun Sep 11
22:31:44 2016) 

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, September 19, 2016
at 600pm local time
</p>

<!-- See Google spreadsheet for collected problem sets and TOTs -->


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to give you exercise with the systems
we will use in CS 5010, and to make sure you know how to commit your
solutions to the CCS github.</p>

<p>Submit your homework following the instructions in <a
href="../Info/homework.html" >Submitting Your Homework</a>, and
include the required <a href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables.</a>
</p>

<p>As of this writing, we do not know whether your private
repositories will be set up in time for this problem set.  If we set
up your private repository, deposit your work there, following the
directions in <a
href="../Info/homework.html" >Submitting Your Homework</a>.  Otherwise, set
up a public repository called <kbd>pdp-YOURNAME</kbd>, where
<kbd>YOURNAME</kbd> is your CCIS login name, in your CCIS github
repository, and deposit your work in a folder called
<kbd>set01</kbd> there.

<p>We will check to see whether you have provided all the deliverable
functions for this problem set, but the problem set will otherwise be
ungraded.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Beginning Student Language to solve the
  problems.  </p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function.
<span class="new">Also, include a line calling
<kbd>check-location</kbd> to check to see if your file is correctly
named and in the right place in your repository.
</span> Thus, for problem 1, the top of your
file should say

<pre>
(require rackunit)
(require "extras.rkt")
<span class="new">(check-location "01" "q1.rkt")</span>

(provide distance-to-origin) 
</pre>
</p>

<p>This will allow our testing framework to import your file and check
 to see that you've provided all the deliverable functions.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the
  Work Session Report that is found <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/hnBjrLa967" >here</a></p>


<hr>

<p>Do the following exercises from <a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html"
>HtDP/2e</a>.  These should all be easy, but be sure to include all of
the items in the design recipe.  If there are no data definitions
necessary, then say so in your file. 
</p>

<p>Note: the numbers of these exercises in HtDP2e may change.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Exercise 11.  Name this function
  <kbd>distance-to-origin</kbd>.</li>

  <li>Exercise 14 (<kbd>string-last</kbd>).</li>

  <li>Exercise 16 (<kbd>image-area</kbd>).</li>

  <li>Exercise 19 (<kbd>string-insert</kbd>). </li>

  <li>Exercise 20 (<kbd>string-delete</kbd>).</li>

</ol>
