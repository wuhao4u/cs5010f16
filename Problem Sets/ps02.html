<!-- See Google spreadsheet for collected problem sets and TOTs -->


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design data
representations for finite data and to write functions that deal with them.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Beginning Student Language to solve the
  problems.  </p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function.  Thus, for problem 1, the top of your
file should say

<pre>
(require rackunit)
(require "extras.rkt")

(provide
  initial-state
  next-state
  accepting-state?
  error-state?
  ) 
</pre>
</p>

<p>This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to follow our <a
  href="Info/coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.  This
  will make the TA's job much easier.</p>

<p>Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the
  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/j1c5C8lFCCULB7lB3" >Work Session Report for
  PS02</a>.  Remember to include "extras.rkt" and any other local
  files you need in your repository folder.</p>

<ol>

<li>  You are to design a set of functions that illustrate the
workings of a finite-state machine for accepting strings that <span
class="new">exactly</span> match
the regular expression <pre>(q | x)* u* (a | b)* d (e | f)*</pre> .
  So all of the following should be accepted:
  <pre>
d
de
df
def
dfe
ad
adf
abbde
uabdef
uuabdef
qd
quaade
qxuuadeff
qxuuabbadeff
  </pre>
  but
<pre>
que
qaud
quaudefd
qxuuaqdef
</pre>
should not.

<p>The legal inputs to the machine are precisely the strings "q", "x",
  "u", "a", "b", "d", "e", and "f".  Any other inputs violate the machine's
contract, and its behavior on those inputs is unspecified.</p>

<p>  First, perform an information analysis and design the data
  representation for the states of your machine.  You may wish to
  write down a state-transition diagram (like the ones <a
  href="https://www.google.com/search?num=10&hl=en&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1109&bih=698&q=state+transition+diagrams&oq=state-transiti&gs_l=img.1.0.0i33l10.1619.3742.0.6264.14.14.0.0.0.0.108.1368.9j5.14.0...0.0...1ac.Ynu6MrP4nAA"
  >here</a>) to illustrate the meaning of
  your state.  Keep your diagram as simple as possible.  You should
  submit your state-transition diagram either as ascii art in your
  solution file, or as a jpg or pdf (called "fsm.jpg" or "fsm.pdf"),
  created in your favorite graphics 
  program. 
</p>

<p> Then design the following functions and <kbd>provide</kbd> them in
a file named <kbd>fsm.rkt</kbd>

  <pre>
initial-state : Number -> State
GIVEN: a number
RETURNS: a representation of the initial state
of your machine.  The given number is ignored.

next-state : State MachineInput -> State
GIVEN: a state of the machine and a machine input
RETURNS: the state that should follow the given input.

accepting-state? : State -> Boolean
GIVEN: a state of the machine
RETURNS: true iff the given state is a final (accepting) state

error-state? : State -> Boolean
GIVEN: a state of the machine
RETURNS: true iff there is no path (empty or non-empty) from the given
state to an accepting state
</pre>

<p>You will need to provide data definitions for State and for
MachineInput.  Be sure to write an interpretation for each state.
There is no need to write an interpretation for MachineInput, since
the problem is already phrased in terms of strings.

  <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  So be sure that your solution is in the right place
  (<kbd>set02/fsm.rkt</kbd> in your private
  <kbd>cs5010f16/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></kbd> repository), and that
  it provides all the functions listed above.  To see if your file is
  in the right place, insert the following line somewhere near the top
  of your file:</p>

  <pre>
(check-location "02" "fsm.rkt")
</pre>

<li> The University has gone on a health campaign and has replaced the
candy machine in the basement with a health-food machine.   The
machine dispenses two kinds of snacks:  kale chips and carrot sticks.
A bag of kale chips is $0.75, and a bag of carrot sticks is $0.50.
The machine accepts only quarters.   A customer can put any number of
quarters in the machine, and then select an item.  If the customer
has deposited enough money into the machine, and the machine is not
out of the selected item, then the machine will dispense the requested
item.  If the machine is out of the selected item, the machine will
flash "Out of Item".  The customer may also press "change", in which
case the machine will return any unspent money that the customer has
put in during the current transaction.  If none of these apply, the
machine does nothing.

<p>For example, the customer may put two 25-cent pieces into the
machine.  If he then selects the carrots, the machine will
dispense a bag of carrots.  If he tries to select the kale
instead, nothing will happen.  If the customer then presses "change",
the machine will return any unspent money that he has deposited.  The
customer may request "change" at any time, whether or not he has
ordered anything.
<!-- and we assume that the machine can always make the -->
<!-- required amount of change. -->
</p>

<p>The machine has a container, called the bank, that contains all the
money it has kept from customers' purchases.  The customer's money is
added to the bank only after he or she has successfully made a purchase.</p>

<p>The possible inputs from the customer are given by the following
data definition:</p>

<pre>
A CustomerInput is one of
-- a PosInt        interp: insert the specified number of quarters
-- "kale"          interp: request a bag of kale chips
-- "carrots"       interp: request a bag of carrots
-- "change"        interp: return all the unspent money that the
                             customer has inserted

A MachineOutput is one of
-- "kale"           interp: machine dispenses a bag of kale chips
-- "carrots"        interp: machine dispenses a bag of carrot sticks
-- "Out of Item"    interp: machine displays "Out of Item"
-- a PosInt         interp: machine releases the specified number of quarters
-- "Nothing"        interp: the machine does nothing
</pre>

  <p>You are to write a file called <kbd>snack-machine.rkt</kbd> that provides
  the following functions:</p>

<pre>
initial-machine : NonNegInt NonNegInt -> MachineState
GIVEN: a number of bags of kale chips and carrot sticks
RETURNS: the state of a machine loaded with the given numbers of bags
of kale chips and carrot sticks, with an empty bank.

machine-next-state : MachineState CustomerInput -> MachineState
GIVEN: a machine state and a customer input
RETURNS: the state of the machine that should follow the customer's
input

machine-output : MachineState CustomerInput -> MachineOutput
GIVEN: a machine state and a customer input
RETURNS: a MachineOutput that describes the machine's response to the
customer input

machine-remaining-kale : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the number of bags of kale chips left in the machine

machine-remaining-carrots : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the number of bags of carrots left in the machine

machine-bank : MachineState -> NonNegInt
GIVEN: a machine state
RETURNS: the amount of money in the machine's bank, in cents
</pre>

  <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution.  So be sure that your solution is in the right place, and that
  it provides all the functions listed above.  You can use
  <kbd>check-location</kbd> to check whether your file is in the right
  place. </p>

</li>



    <li>Your space probe to Pluto has just landed.  Here's the situation:
<p></p>
  <ol>

    <li>At every step, the probe can move forward some number of
    steps, or it can rotate 90 degrees either right or left.  The
    probe moves by taking steps of exactly 1 cm.</li>
    
    <li>The probe has landed facing north (up).</li>

    <li>We will use graphics-style coordinates instead of standard
    mathematical coordinates. That is, when the probe moves north, its
    y-coordinate DECREASES.  So if it takes one step north from the
    origin, it is at (0, -1).</li>
    
    <li>The probe's mechanism is a little unreliable.  If you send it
    forward by some number of steps, it may take an extra step, or it
    may take one step too few.  However, it will never move backwards,
    nor will it ever turn by mistake.</li>

  </ol>
  
  <p>You are to write a file called <kbd>probe.rkt</kbd> that provides
  the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
probe-at: Integer Integer -> Probe
GIVEN: an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate
RETURNS: a probe with its center at those coordinates, facing north.

probe-turned-left : Probe -> Probe
probe-turned-right : Probe -> Probe
GIVEN: a probe
RETURNS: a probe like the original, but turned 90 degrees either left
or right.

probe-direction-equal? : Probe Probe -> Boolean
GIVEN: two probes
RETURNS: true iff the two probes are facing in the same direction,
else false

probe-location-equal? : Probe Probe -> Boolean
GIVEN: two probles
RETURNS: true iff the two probes are at the same location

probe-forward-possible-outcome? : Probe PosInt Probe -> Boolean
GIVEN: two probes and a distance
RETURNS: true iff the first probe, given a move-forward command with
the specified number of steps, could wind up in the state described by
the second probe.
  </pre>

<!-- <p>Note: When the specification groups functions as we have done here, -->
<!--   you need only write down the purpose statement once (as we have done -->
<!--   here). If your design strategy is the same for all the functions, -->
<!--   then you only have to write that down once. Of course your -->
<!--   examples must cover all the functions.</p> -->

 <!-- <p>We will be doing automated testing of your solution.  In order to -->
 <!-- see whether you have correctly provided the indicated functions, load -->
 <!-- a copy of <a href="ps02-probe-tests.rkt" -->
 <!-- ><kbd>ps02-probe-tests.rkt</kbd></a> into your -->
 <!-- directory and run it.  This file tests only that you have provided -->
 <!-- all the functions you are supposed to.  Make sure your solution -->
 <!-- passes those tests before you turn in your problem set.</p> -->

    <p>As before, remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
  solution. Same story as for the preceding problems.</p>
