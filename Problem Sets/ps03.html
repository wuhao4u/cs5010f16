<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 03: Iterative Design</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, September 26, 2016

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 3, 2016
at 600pm
local time
</p>

<!-- See Google spreadsheet for collected problem sets and TOTs -->


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions that deal
with the Universe model, and to give you practice with the Iterative
Design Recipe.</p>

<p>You will also get experience with the Perfect Bounce and Smooth
Dragging, which we will be using in many of our exercises.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP <span class="strike">Beginning</span> <span
class="new">Intermediate</span> Student Language to solve the problems.
</p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Also, be sure to
include extras.rkt in the folder that you submit. Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.  You can use <kbd>check-location</kbd>, as
you did on the preceding problem set, to double-check that your
solutions are in the right place.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.   Be sure to follow our <a
  href="../Info/coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.  This
  will make the TA's job much easier.</p>

<p>Be sure to sync your work and fill out a Work Session Report at the
  end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/VIBv1pfY16eqp9E72" >Work Session Report for
  PS03</a>.</p> 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs, you may assume
that the mouse is never dragged or moved outside of the canvas.  Once
the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas, then
the behavior of your system is unspecified.</p>

<ol>

  <li>(screensaver-1).  Your boss has assigned you to a project to
  build a screensaver.  The specifications for the screensaver are as
  follows:<p></p>

  <ul>

    <li> The screensaver is a universe program that displays two
    circles that move around a canvas.</li>

    <li> Each circle is displayed as an outline blue circle with a
    radius of 40 pixels. In addition, the circle's
    current velocity is displayed as a string (vx, vy) in the center
    of the circle.  </li>

    <li>The circles bounce smoothly off the edge of the
    canvas. Bouncing is defined as follows: if the circle in its
    normal motion would hit or go past one side of the canvas at the
    next tick, then instead at the next tick it should appear tangent
    to the edge of the canvas, travelling at the same speed, but in
    the opposite direction.  If the circle would go past a corner,
    then both the x- and y- velocities are reversed.  We call
    this a <em>perfect bounce</em>.

    <p>
    <span
    class="new">Here's a clarification (thanks to Professor Clinger):

    <p class="new">The x and y coordinates of a circle are constrained to keep the
    entire circle within the canvas at all times.  If a circle's
    position and velocity would cause any part of a circle to lie
    outside of the canvas at the end of a tick, then its x and y
    coordinates at the end of that tick are calculated as follows:
    first calculate the new x and y coordinates without regard to the
    boundaries, and then adjust those calculated coordinates
    (separately) by the smallest adjustments that keep the entire
    circle within the canvas.  If an x or y coordinate is adjusted
    during that process, then the corresponding velocity component
    is reversed as well.</p>

    <p class="new">Example: A circle whose center is at x=45 and y=80, with
    velocity components vx=-15 and vy=20 would appear at x=30, if
    it were unconstrained by the wall.  So at the next tick, the
    center should be at x=40 and y = 100, with velocity components
    vx=15 and vy=20.</p>

    </span>

    </li>

    <li>The space bar pauses or unpauses the entire simulation.  The
    simulation is initially paused.
    </li>


    <li>The canvas is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high. 
    </li>

    <li> The two circles are initially centered at positions
    (200,100) and (200,200), and have velocities of (-12, 20) and (23,
    -14), respectively. Remember that we are using computer-graphics
    coordinates, in which y increases as you go down the page
    (south) and in which (0,0) is the upper left-hand corner of the
    canvas. </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Here's a demo:</p>


  <p><center>
<video src="ps03-demo1.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>

  <p>You are to deliver a file named <kbd>screensaver-1.rkt</kbd> that
  provides the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
;; screensaver : PosReal -> WorldState
;; GIVEN: the speed of the simulation, in seconds/tick
;; EFFECT: runs the simulation, starting with the initial state as
;; specified in the problem set.
;; RETURNS: the final state of the world

;; initial-world : Any -> WorldState
;; GIVEN: any value (ignored)
;; RETURNS: the initial world specified in the problem set

;; world-after-tick : WorldState -> WorldState
;; RETURNS: the world state that should follow the given world state
;; after a tick.

;; world-after-key-event : WorldState KeyEvent -> WorldState
;; RETURNS: the WorldState that should follow the given worldstate
;; after the given keyevent

;; world-circ1 : WorldState -> Circle
;; world-circ2 : WorldState -> Circle
;; world-paused? : WorldState -> Boolean
;; RETURNS: the specified attribute of the WorldState
;; NOTE: if these are part of the world struct, you don't need to
;; write any deliverables for these functions.

;; new-circle : NonNegInt NonNegInt Int Int -> Circle
;; GIVEN: 2 non-negative integers x and y, and 2 integers vx and vy
;; RETURNS: a circle centered at (x,y), which will travel with
;; velocity (vx, vy).

;; circ-x : Circle -> NonNegInt
;; circ-y : Circle -> NonNegInt
;; circ-vx : Circle -> Int
;; circ-vy : Circle -> Int
;; RETURNS: the coordinates of the center of the circle and its
;; velocity in the x- and y- directions.
</pre>

</li>


<li>(screensaver-2).  Your boss has now decided to build a better
    screensaver.  This one is like the original, except for the
    following:<p></p>

  <ul>

    <li> Each circle is selectable and draggable.  Depressing the
    mouse button within a circle causes the circle to be
    "selected".  When a circle is selected, it <span class="strike">and its velocity</span>
    are displayed in red instead of blue.</li>

    <p>When the mouse button is down, its location should be indicated
    by a solid red circle with a radius of 5 pixels. </p>

    <li>Once a circle has been selected, you should be able to
    drag it around the Universe canvas with the mouse.  As you drag
    it, the position of the mouse within the circle (as indicated
    by the red circle), should not change.  When the mouse button is
    released, the circle should go back to its unselected state
    (outline blue) in its new location.  </li>

    <li>We refer to this behavior as "smooth dragging."  We will be
    implementing other objects with this behavior in future problem
    sets.  </li>

    <span class="new"><li>A selected circle may be dragged in a way that causes some of
    it to be dragged outside the canvas.  If, when the circle is
    unselected, some or all of it is outside the canvas, its motion is
    determined by the same rules as in the previous question.
    Example:  A circle is dragged so that its center  is at x=25
    and y=80, with
    velocity components vx=-15 and vy=20, and is then released.  At
    the next tick, it should have its center at <span
    class="strike">x=20</span> <span style="color:blue">x=40</span> and y=100, while its velocity
    components would become vx=15 and vy=20.
    </li></span>

    <li>All of this works whether or not the simulation is paused.
    </li>


  </ul>


  <p>Here's a demo:</p>

  <p><center>
<video src="ps03-demo2.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>

  <p>  <p>You are to deliver a file named <kbd>screensaver-2.rkt</kbd> that
  provides all the functions above, plus the following:</p>

  <pre>
;; world-after-mouse-event
;;  : WorldState Int Int MouseEvent -> WorldState
;; GIVEN: A World, the x- and y-coordinates of a mouse event, and the
;; mouse event
;; RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after the given mouse
;; event.

;; circ-after-mouse-event :  Circle Int Int MouseEvent -> Circle
;; GIVEN: A circle, the x- and y-coordinates of a mouse event, and the
;; mouse event
;; RETURNS: the circle that should follow the given circle after
;; the given mouse event

;; circ-selected? : Circle -> Boolean
;; RETURNS: true iff the given circle is selected.

;; new-circle
;; as before, but now it returns an UNSELECTED circle.
</pre>


</ul>
</li>

</ol>
