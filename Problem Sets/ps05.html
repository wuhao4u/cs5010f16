<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 05: Working with Higher-Order Functions</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, October 10, 2016

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 17, 2016
at 600pm
local time
</p>


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions using 
higher-order functions like map, filter, foldr, etc.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Intermediate Student Language + Lambda to solve the
  problems.  You are to use HOFs wherever it is appropriate.  These
  will replace almost all the uses of the List template.</p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to follow our <a
  href="Info/coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.  This
  will make the TA's job much easier.</p>

<p>Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/67rSNKoNTIIWyReG3" >Work Session Report for
  PS05</a>.</p>

  <li>(The absent-minded professors, part 2). Reimplement the last
  problem from last week's problem set (class-lists.rkt), but using
  HOFs wherever possible and appropriate.  Use the filename
  <kbd>class-lists.rkt</kbd>, as you did before.  </li>

<li>(The nervous registrar) The Registrar has heard about your
excellent work with the absent-minded professors and so he asks you to
help him solve the following problem:

<p>He needed a program to take a list of (student, class) pairs, and
  produce a list of class rosters, one roster for each class that has
  at least one student enrolled (detailed specifications below).  He
  hired several teams of Racket programmers who had never taken PDP,
  and therefore produced solutions that were late and over-budget.
  Now he needs your help to test their solutions.</p>

<p> You are to design a tester that will accept any good solution to
the registrar's original problem, and reject any incorrect
solution. Your solution should be in the form of a file called
<kbd>test-rosters.rkt</kbd>.  Here are more detailed specifications:
</p>

<pre>
An EnrollmentAssertion is a (make-enrollment Student Class).
(make-enrollment s c) represents the assertion that student s is
enrolled in class c.

A ClassRosterAssertion is a (make-roster Class SetOfStudent).
(make-roster c ss) represents the assertion that the students in class
c are exactly the students in set ss.

Student is unspecified, but you may assume that students may be
compared for equality with equal?

Class is unspecified, but you may assume that classes may be
compared for equality with equal?

Your code should not depend on your choice of data type; that
is, it should work for any definition of Student and Class (so long as
each is testable using equal?, as specified above).

A SetOfX is a list of X's without duplication.  Two SetOfX's are
considered equal if they have the same members.

Example: (list (list 1 2) (list 2 1)) is NOT a SetOfSetOfNumber,
because (list 1 2) and (list 2 1) represent the same set of numbers. 

A ProposedSolution is a function with contract
SetOfEnrollmentAssertion -> SetOfClassRosterAssertion
that is, it is a function that takes a SetOfEnrollmentAssertion and
produces a SetOfClassRosterAssertion

EXAMPLE:
If soln1 is a ProposedSolution, we might have
  (soln1
    (list (make-enrollment "John" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Kathryn" "Networks")
          (make-enrollment "Feng" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Amy" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Amy" "Networks")))
=>
 (list
   (make-roster "PDP" (list "John" "Feng" "Amy"))
   (make-roster "Networks" (list "Kathryn" "Amy")))

This is an example of correct behavior by a ProposedSolution.

In the output of a correct ProposedSolution, the classes may be in any
order, and the students in each class may be in any order, but there
must be no duplication of classes and no duplication of students
within a class.

You are to provide the following functions:

make-enrollment
enrollment-student
enrollment-class
make-roster
roster-classname
roster-students

behavior-correct? : ProposedSolution SetOfEnrollment -> Boolean
GIVEN: a ProposedSolution soln-fn and a SetOfEnrollments se
RETURNS: true iff the output of soln-fn on se is an example of correct
behavior by a ProposedSolution.
EXAMPLE: See example above

enrollments-to-rosters: SetOfEnrollment -> SetOfClassRoster
GIVEN: a set of enrollments
RETURNS: a correct set of class rosters for the given enrollments

enrollments-to-rosters-bad-1: SetOfEnrollment -> SetOfClassRoster
enrollments-to-rosters-bad-2: SetOfEnrollment -> SetOfClassRoster
enrollments-to-rosters-bad-3: SetOfEnrollment -> SetOfClassRoster
GIVEN: a set of enrollments
RETURN: an incorrect set of class rosters for the given enrollments
</pre>

<p>Test your <kbd>behavior-correct?</kbd> function by writing a correct
<kbd>enrollments-to-rosters</kbd> function and several incorrect ones (the 3
shown above are just a start).</p>

<p>The problem requires that your solution work for any choice of
representation of Student and Class, so long as they are testable for
equality using equal?, so you should also test your solution using at
least two different data types for Student and Class.  You may assume
that any ProposedSolution also works for any such choice of data types.</p>

<p>As elsewhere in this problem set, use HOFs whenever possible and
appropriate. </p>

  <p>You will find this problem much easier if you follow the slogan
"The Structure of the Program Follows the Structure of the Data".  To
help you with this concept, please must turn in a file containing the
call graph for your program.  This file must show which functions call
which, so we (and you) can see the overall structure of your program.
You may turn this in as a text file, pdf, jpg, or Racket file.  Call
your file <kbd>call-tree</kbd> with an appropriate suffix, and bring a
paper copy to your codewalk.</p>
