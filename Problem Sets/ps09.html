<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 9</h1>

<p><strong>Out:</strong> Monday, November 7, 2016

<hr>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design simple class
systems and methods on them.
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>As always, you must follow the design recipe, in this case the OO
Design Recipe and deliverables as spelled out in Lesson 9.5 and in <a
href="../Info/deliverables.html#oo-deliverables"
  >deliverables.html</a></li>

  <li>Be sure to sync your
  work and fill out a Work Session Report at the end of every work
  session.  Use the
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/c0zQZmGAN632iFO13" >Work Session Report for
  PS09</a>.
  </li>




  <li> As part of the data analysis step, you must create a class
  diagram that can be displayed during the codewalk. For each
  interface, list the method names (contracts are optional).  For each
  class, indicate the init-fields and their types; if the value of the
  init-field is an object or list of objects, draw arrows to the type
  of the 
  field. You may draw this diagram by hand, create it as an ASCII test
  file, or use your favorite diagramming tool.  If you use a tool, you
  must deliver it in pdf format.  The diagram need not be elaborate.
  For each interface, it must show the method names.  Contracts are
  optional. For each class, it should show the class name, the
  interface the class implements and the fields and their types.</li>
  
  
  <p>Here's an example: <center><img height="300" src="Images/09-2A-space-invaders-2.jpg" ></center></p>

  <li> You should have no structs in your solution: every struct should
  be replaced by a class.
  You may, however, use ordinary Racket lists.</li>

  <!-- <li>You can treat key events and mouse events as scalar data, as you -->
  <!-- have done in the past. -->

  <!-- ordinary data -->
  <!-- definitions, and define alternate enumerations (like -->
  <!-- AnimationKeyEvent) as you have in the past. -->



<li>Please restrict yourself to the language features discussed in
class.  In particular, you may NOT use state (<kbd>set!</kbd>)
or inheritance <span class="new">of classes. You may, however, use
  interface inheritance (see the examples below).</span></li> 





<li>You must use <kbd>#lang racket</kbd>, <kbd>rackunit</kbd>,
<kbd>"extras.rkt"</kbd>, <kbd>2htdp/universe</kbd>, and
<kbd>2htdp/image</kbd>.  So your file should begin something like

<pre>
#lang racket
(require rackunit)
(require "extras.rkt")
(require 2htdp/universe)   
(require 2htdp/image)      
</pre>

You may require "sets.rkt" if you need it.  You may not
<kbd>require</kbd> any other libraries.</li>


</ul>

<p>Problem:</p>

<p>Your boss at NextPython, Inc. spent the weekend at a wild party in
the Valley, where he spent too much time taking drugs and listening to
American folk music from the 1960's.  He has come out of his hangover
just long enough to pull you off your GarterSnake project and tell you
to to build a
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahWcocGtEyA"
>marvelous toy</a>, called the MetaToy.  The MetaToy will consist of a
canvas on which the child will paint and interact with a variety of toys.
</p> 

<ul><p></p>

  <li>The MetaToy consists of a canvas that is 500
  pixels wide  and 600 pixels high.</li>

  <li>The child interacts with the MetaToy by using the mouse and by
  typing characters into the system. 
  Each of the characters listed below causes a new mini-toy to be created
  with its center located at the center of the canvas.  Most of the
  mini-toys are also moveable using smooth drag. </li>

  <!-- <li>When the child types "s", a new square-shaped toy pops up.  It -->
  <!-- is represented as a 40x40 pixel outline square.  When a -->
  <!-- square-shaped toy appears, it begins travelling rightward  -->
  <!-- at a constant rate.  When its edge reaches the edge of the canvas, -->
  <!-- it executes a Perfect Bounce. -->
  <!-- </li> -->

  <li>When the child types "t", a new mini-toy called a throbber
  appears.  A throbber starts as a solid green circle of radius 5.  At
  every tick, it expands gradually until it reaches a radius of 20.
  Once it reaches a radius of 20, it contracts gradually until it
  reaches a radius of 5, and then resumes its cycle. It can be
  selected and moved using smooth drag. When it is selected, it
  appears in outline mode.</li>

  <li>When the child types "c", a clock mini-toy appears.  This clock displays
  the number of ticks since it was created.  Otherwise the appearance
  of the clock is unspecified.  Like the throbber, the clock can be
  selected and moved using smooth drag.</li>

  <li>When the child types "p", a Politician mini-toy appears.  A
  politician has some interesting behaviors:</li>

  <ul>
    <li>The politician appears as an image that is approximately a
    square 60 pixels on a side.  (It doesn't have to be exactly
    square, or exactly 60 pixels.  Choose something that is visually
    satisfying.) </li>
    
    <li>The politician always moves in a straight line either towards
    the mouse position or away from it.  However, he never reaches or
    passes the mouse position.</li>

    <li>The politician always pays close attention to the polls.  In
    this context, this means that the politician takes notice of every
    mouse event (button-down, button-up, drag, and move). </li>

    <li>A politician will always follow you, at a distance.  When the
    center of the politician is at least 75 pixels away from the mouse
    position, the politician moves towards the mouse.</li>

    <li>However, when the politician gets within 75 pixels of the
    mouse, he gets frightened and moves away rapidly from the mouse.
    (So the child can repel the politician by following him
    around.)</li>

    <li>The speed with which the politician moves either towards or
    away from the mouse is up to you.  Choose something that is
    visually satisfying.</li>

    <li>As is well-known, politicians are two-faced.  When the
    politician jumps away from the mouse, he will come back with a
    different face.  Go out on the internet and find pictures of
    Hillary and Trump to depict the politician.  Or you can use
    pictures of your favorite politicians from your home country, so
    long as the TA will be able to tell them apart easily.</li>

  </ul>

  <li>As usual, you are not responsible for anything that happens after
  the mouse leaves the canvas.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are many unspecified parameters in the description above.
Choose parameters (like speed, the exact way in which items grow and
shrink, etc.) so that the result is visually satisfying.</p>

<p>I believe this problem is easier than the last one, so have some
fun with it. </p>

<p>It is acceptable (and even encouraged) to reuse code from the
Example files.</p>

    <p>Here's a demo.   </p>

<p><center>
<video width="300" src="ps09-demo.mp4" controls/>
</center></p>

<p>Your solution should be a file named <kbd>q1.rkt</kbd> and
should provide the following interfaces and functions:</p>

<pre>
make-metatoy : ListOfToys -> Metatoy
RETURNS: a Metatoy with the given list of toys.
NOTE: The Metatoy<%> interface extends the World<%> interface, so the
result of make-metatoy is something that big-bang can use as a world.

run : PosNum -> Metatoy
GIVEN: a frame rate (in seconds/tick)
EFFECT: creates a MetaToy with no toys in it, and runs it using big-bang
at the given frame rate.  Returns the final state of the Metatoy.

make-throbber: PosInt PosInt -> Toy
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a throbber at the given position.

make-clock : PosInt PosInt -> Toy
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a clock at the given position.

make-politician : PosInt PosInt -> Toy
GIVEN: an x and a y position
RETURNS: an object representing a politician at the given position.

Interfaces:

;; A Metatoy is an object of any class that implements Metatoy<%>.
;; (You will only need one such class)

(define Metatoy<%>
  (interface 
  <span class="new">
   ;; the (World<%>) says that Metatoy<%> <em>inherits</em> from World<%>
   ;; This means that any class that implements Metatoy<%> must
   ;; implement all the methods from World<%> plus all the methods
   ;; defined here. In this case, there is just one additional method,
   ;; called get-toys.
   </span>(World<%>)

    ;; -> ListOfToy
    get-toys

))

;; A Toy is an object of any class that implements Toy<%>
;; You will probably have three such classes, one for each kind of toy. 

(define Toy<%> 
  (interface
  <span class="new">
   ;; The interface Toy<%> inherits from the interface Widget<%>.
   ;; This means that any class that implements Toy<%> must implement
   ;; all the methods from Widget<%> plus all the methods defined here.
   </span>(Widget<%>)


    ;; Note: the Widgets of the space-invader-examples don't respond
    ;; to mouse "move" events, but some of our toys do.  So we add an
    ;; after-move method to the interface.

    ;;  Int Int -> Toy
    ;;  RETURNS: the state of this toy that should follow a mouse-move
    ;;  at the given coordinates
    after-move

 
    ;; -> Int
    ;; RETURNS: the x or y position of the center of the toy
    toy-x
    toy-y

    ;; -> Int
    ;; RETURNS: some data related to the toy.  The interpretation of
    ;; this data depends on the class of the toy.
    ;; for a throbber, it is the current radius of the throbber
    ;; for the clock, it is the current value of the clock
    ;; for a politician, it is the current distance to the mouse
    toy-data


    ))
</pre>


<p>When you do this problem, remember the principle of Iterative
Development: get something simple working, and then add features as
necessary. </p>

<p>Effective with this problem, you may turn in your solution as a set
of files; our scripts will collect all of the files in your set09
directory.  Just make sure that your q1.rkt provides all the required
functions.  If you do split your solution across several files, we
recommend that you have a file named <kbd>interfaces.rkt</kbd> that
provides all of your interfaces and then one file for each class you define.
